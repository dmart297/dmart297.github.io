                    <p>Hello! My name is Drew Marting and 
                        I am a second-year Computer Science Major.
                        My hometown is Carlsbad, San Diego where I live ~10 <em>minutes</em> away from 
                        the closest beach. 
                    </p>
                    <p>When I'm not studying, I <strong>love</strong> to play the drums, read,
                        knit, and play video games. On campus, I am part of Women Involved in Software and Hardware, Intramural Soccer, the Cal Poly Cat Program, and
                        United Mvmnt. Basically, I believe in being involved! I think it's a great way to meet new people, 
                        gain new insights, and make the most out of my overall college experience. Luckily, one of my greatest skills is time management, so I get to be part of many things 
                        while giving them <strong>all</strong> equal attention.
