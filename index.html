            <p>Hello! My name is Drew Marting and 
                I am a second-year Computer Science Major.
                My hometown is Carlsbad, San Diego where I live ~10 minutes away from 
                the closest beach. When I'm not studying, I love to play the drums, read,
                knit, and play video games. On campus, I am part of Women Involved in Software and Hardware, Intramural Soccer, and
                United Mvmnt. 
            </p>
